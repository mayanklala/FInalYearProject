On 6th Dec 1992, the illegal demolition of the Babri Masjid was carried out by a large group of activits of the allied organisation which included the Vishva Hindu Parishad. As a result, the 16th century Babri Masjid, which is situated in Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh, had been the centre of many lengthy socio political disputes which has been constantly targeted by political parties and the rallies which they organise during the campaigns.

Lord Ram, from the Hindu mythology, is said to be born in the city of Ayodhya. Mir Baqi, a Mughal general, came to this city in the 16th century and constructed a mosque at a sight which was identified as the Ram Janmabhoomi, i.e. the birthplace of Lord Ram, by some Hindus. When an archaeological survey was conducted in various Indian states, it was found that the mosque was built on a piece of land where there existed no history of islamic culture. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad began it's campaign for building the temple that would be solely dedicated to Lord Ram. It was in 1980s that they joined Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, as its pilitical voice. Ram Rath Yatra, which was led by L.K. Advani, was one of the biggest rallies that took place for this cause which was followed bu several other rallies and marches.
